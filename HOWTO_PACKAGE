First, make sure that config.sh looks correct, and that

  - $ref_eval_upstream_dir/$ref_eval_pkg.tar.gz and
  - $rsem_eval_upstream_dir/$rsem_eval_pkg.tar.gz

both exist and are up to date.

Second, run:

$ bash package.sh

This will create a tarball for distribution. It will also create HTML files for
the website.

Third, copy the HTML files and the tarball to the website:

$ bash update_website.sh

(You might want to do this last step manually, following the script as an
example, just to be safe.)
