First, make sure that config.sh looks correct.

Second, run:

$ bash package.sh

This will create a tarball for distribution. It will also create HTML files for
the website.

Third, copy the HTML files and the tarball to the website:

$ bash update_website.sh

(You might want to do this last step manually, following the script as an
example, just to be safe.)
