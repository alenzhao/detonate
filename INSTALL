To build REF-EVAL, simply run "make" from the current directory. This will
build a single executable (plus a few dependent libraries), ./ref-eval, which
you can run from the current directory or move elsewhere. (The executable is
statically linked with the local dependencies, so you don't need to worry about
the library path.) For information about how to run REF-EVAL once it is built,
see ./README.

If the "make" command fails, you might need to tweak the build process a bit.
To do so, edit ./Makefile and make changes as appropriate to the section marked
"Configuration". Then run "make" again.

REF-EVAL comes with a number of unit tests. To build and run these tests, run
"make test" from the current directory. A C++11-compatible compiler is required
to build some of the tests.
